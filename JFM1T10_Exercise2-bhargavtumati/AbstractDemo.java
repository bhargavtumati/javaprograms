/* Objective of this program is to understand abstraction and abstract classes.
Let's declare an abstract class and create a concrete method and declare an abstract method.
Itâ€™s  more valid to declare a method once in a parent class rather than over and over again in multiple subclasses
Now in child class, It is must to define abstract method of super class else compiler would throw an error*/
